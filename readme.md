## Contribute

if you want to contribute, simply fork this repository and add a .json file to the corpus/ folder containing your words. It should be formatted as such:

```JSON
{
	"description": "A description of what you're adding, preferably with credit to you.",
	"words":
	[
		"your",
		"words",
		"go",
		"here"
	]
}
```

Then submit a pull request. If your words are interesting and formatted correctly, I'll include you in the corpus.
